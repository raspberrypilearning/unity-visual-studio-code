## Unity and Visual Studio Code

Unity uses the C# programming language, which is used by professional software developers. To write code for Unity you will need to add an external code editor.

Many different code editors can be used, and Unity recommends the full Community edition of Visual Studio, however this requires another account.

Instead we would recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free lightweight code editor from Microsoft that you can use to write code in almost any language, including C# with Unity.

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your operating system.

Once you install the Visual Studio code editor you can add functionality using **Extensions**.

The two we recommend are:
1. **C#** by Microsoft - this gives you code completion for the C# language
2. **Unity Code Snippets** by Kleber Silva - will give you specific completions for Unity

You can find these by opening the extensions menu is the left side bar (highlighted above) and typing the names into the search bar at the top, you can then click on the extension and click the blue **Install** button under the name.

Install the two recommended extensions, C# and Unity Code snippets.

Open Unity. **edit** पर क्लिक करें और फिर मेनू से **प्राथमिकताएँ** चुनें।

In the menu on the left, select **External Tools** and in the drop-down menu for **External Script Editor** choose **Visual Studio Code**.
